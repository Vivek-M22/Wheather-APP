# 🌦️ Python GUI Weather App

A simple and clean **desktop weather application** built with Python's **Tkinter** library that fetches and displays real-time weather data from the **OpenWeatherMap API**.

## 📖 About The Project
This project is a beginner-friendly example of how to create a **graphical user interface (GUI)** in Python and connect it to a third-party API to fetch live data.  

Users can enter a city name, and the app will display:
- 🌡️ Current temperature  
- 🌤️ Weather conditions  
- 💧 Humidity  
- 🌬️ Wind speed  
- And more!
